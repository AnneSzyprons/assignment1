# First assignment #

## Exercise 1 ##

**1. Do you have any prior experience in the field introduced in the introductory session? If so, give a short overview on them.**<br>

I have no experiences in this field.<br>

**2. What expectations or wishes do you have on the data modeling course?**

I'm working in a reinsurance department of an insurance cmpany and we just have started a project about modeling data of nature catastrophes. Maybe I can learn something new to support my team or just have a better understanding in how the theory works. And obviously, I'd like to learn how to be a hacker ;)
