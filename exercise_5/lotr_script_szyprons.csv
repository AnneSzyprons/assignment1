Eowyn,There. A true esquire of Rohan.,The_Return_of_the_King
Merry,I'm ready! Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. It's not even sharp.,The_Return_of_the_King
Eowyn,"To the smithy, go!",The_Return_of_the_King
Eomer,You should not encourage him.,The_Return_of_the_King
Eowyn,You should not doubt him.,The_Return_of_the_King
Eomer,"I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.",The_Return_of_the_King
Eowyn,Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause to go to war as you. Why can he not fight for those he loves?,The_Return_of_the_King
Eomer,You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold. Do you think he would stand and fight? He would flee. And he would be right to do so. War is the province of men Eowyn.,The_Return_of_the_King

Theoden,I take my leave.,The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,My lord Elrond.,The_Return_of_the_King
Elrond,I come on behalf of one whom I love. Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us Aragorn. The end has come.,The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,"It will not be our end, but his.",The_Return_of_the_King
Elrond,"You ride to war but not to victory. Sauron's armies ride on Minas Tirith, this you know. But in secret he sends another force, which will attack, from the river. A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South. They will be in the city in two days. You're outnumbered Aragorn. You need more men.",The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,There are none.,The_Return_of_the_King
Elrond,There are those that dwell in the mountain.,The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,"Murderers, traitors. You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing. They answer to no one.",The_Return_of_the_King
Elrond,"They will answer to the King of Gondor. And'ril, the Flame of the West, forged from the shards of Narsil.",The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil. The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.,The_Return_of_the_King
Elrond,The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the Ranger. Become who you were born to be 'nen i-Estel Edain.,The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,'-chebin Estel anim.,The_Return_of_the_King
Eowyn,Why are you doing this? The war lies to the East. You cannot leave on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon the men.,The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,What were you thinking Peregrin Took? What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of men?,The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,It was well done. A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. You are to join the tower guard.,The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.,The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,It once belonged to a young boy of the city. A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending his studies.,The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,This was yours?,The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,"Yes, it was mine. My father had it made for me.",The_Return_of_the_King

Eowyn,Do you not know?,The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek. I have wished you joy since first I saw you.,The_Return_of_the_King
Gimli,Just where do you think you're off to?,The_Return_of_the_King
Aragorn,Not this time. This time you must stay Gimli.,The_Return_of_the_King
Gimli,Hmmmm.,The_Return_of_the_King
Legolas,Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?,The_Return_of_the_King
Gimli,You might as well accept it. We're going with you laddie. Aragorn smiles.,The_Return_of_the_King
Soldier,"What's happening, where is he going? I don't understand. (,) Lord Aragorn! Why does he leave on the eve of battle?",The_Return_of_the_King
Gamling,He leaves because there is no hope.,The_Return_of_the_King
Theoden,He leaves because he must.,The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,"Well, I'm taller than you were then. Though, I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.",The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,"It never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier. They were so alike he and my father. Proud, stubborn even, but strong.",The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,"I think you have strength of a different kind. And one day your father will see it. Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor in peace or war, in living or dying, from ' from this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death take me.",The_Return_of_the_King
Denethor,And I shall not forget it! nor fail to reward that which is given. Fealty with love. Valour with honour. Disloyalty with vengeance. I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defences. Defences that your brother long held intact.,The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,What would you have me do?,The_Return_of_the_King
Denethor,I will not yield the River and Pellenor unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken.,The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,My lord Osgiliath is over run.,The_Return_of_the_King
Denethor,Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?,The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,You wish now that our places had been exchanged. That I had died and Boromir had lived.,The_Return_of_the_King
Denethor,"Yes, I wish that.",The_Return_of_the_King
Gamling,To few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.,The_Return_of_the_King
Theoden,"No, we cannot. But we will meet them in battle nonetheless. I have left instruction. The people are to follow your rule in my stead. Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras, if the battle goes ill.",The_Return_of_the_King
Eowyn,What other duty would you have me do my lord?,The_Return_of_the_King
Theoden,"Duty? no. I would have you smile again, not grieve for those whose time has come. You shall live to see these days renewed ' and no more despair.",The_Return_of_the_King
Faramir,"Since you are robbed of Boromir I will do what I can in his stead. If I should return, think better of me father.",The_Return_of_the_King

Frodo,"I can't do this, Sam.",The_Two_Towers
Sam,"I know. It's all wrong. By rights, we shouldn't even be here. But we are. It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. . . . . because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was. . . . . . when so much bad had happened?",The_Two_Towers
Theoden,Victory! We have victory!,The_Two_Towers
Sam_Voice-over,"But in the end, it's only a passing thing. . . . . . this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.

Pippin,Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south.,The_Two_Towers
Treebeard,South? But that will lead you past lsengard.,The_Two_Towers
Pippin,"Yes. Exactly. If we go south, we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect.",The_Two_Towers
Treebeard,That doesn't make sense to me. But then. . . . . . you are very small. Perhaps you're right. South it is then. Hold on little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going downhill.,The_Two_Towers

Pippin,"I'm sorry, Treebeard.",The_Two_Towers
Treebeard,They had voices of their own. Saruman. A wizard should know better! There is no curse in Elvish. . . . . . Entish or the tongues of Men. . . . . . for this treachery.,The_Two_Towers

Merry,How can that be your decision?!,The_Two_Towers
Treebeard,This is not our war.,The_Two_Towers
Merry,But you're part of this world! Aren't you?! You must help. Please. You must do something.,The_Two_Towers
Treebeard,You are young and brave Master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.,The_Two_Towers

The old wisdom born out of the west was forsaken. Kings made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living and counted the old names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry or in high, cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin. The line of Kings failed. The white tree withered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.",The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,Mordor.,The_Return_of_the_King
Gandalf,"Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.",The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,A storm is coming.,The_Return_of_the_King
Gandalf,"This is not the weather of the world. This is a device of Sauron's making. A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight, so he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city it will begin.",The_Return_of_the_King
Pippin,Well' Minas Tirith' very impressive. So where are off to next?,The_Return_of_the_King

Gandalf,Indeed?,The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Frodo,"We never had any adventures, or did anything unexpected.",The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Gandalf,"If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.",The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring

Frodo,He escaped the dungeons of Barad-D'r!,The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Gandalf,"Escaped or was set loose and now the Ring has drawn him here He won't ever be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself. Smeagol's life is a sad story Yes he was once called, before the Ring found him. Before it drove him mad.",The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Frodo,It's a pity Bilbo didnt kill him when he had the chance.,The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Gandalf,"Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death and many that die, deserve life. Can you give it to them Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death and judgement Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play, yet for good or ill.... before this is over. The pity of Bilbo, may rule the fate of many.",The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Frodo,I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.,The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Gandalf,"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it and that is an encouraging thought. Oh! Its that way.",The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring

Frodo,What are they?,The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Strider,They were once men. Great Kings of Men. The Sauron the Deciever gave to them nine rings of power. Blinded by their greed they took them without question. One by one falling into darknessNow they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazg'l. Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

Gandalf,He's very fond of you.,The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring
Bilbo,"I know, he'd probably come with me if I asked him to. I think in his heart Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods, the fields and the little rivers. I am old Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. I feel thin, sort of stretched like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday, a very long holiday.

Pippin,He asked me my name. I didn't answer. He hurt me!,The_Return_of_the_King
Gandalf,What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring? There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring. We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantir a glimpse of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.,The_Return_of_the_King
Gandalf,"His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing. He knows the Heir of Elendil has come forth Men are not as weak as he supposed. There is courage still. Strength enough, perhaps, to challenge him. Sauron fears this. He will not risk the peoples of Middle Earth uniting under one banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the beacons of Gondor are lit Rohan must be ready for war.",The_Return_of_the_King

Aragorn,Merry!,The_Return_of_the_King
Merry,He's always followed me everywhere I went since before we were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble but I was always there to get him out. Now he's gone. Just like Frodo and Sam.,The_Return_of_the_King
