# Exercise 5 #
## Exercise 5.1. ##
There are four different data fields. 
The first one shows the number of the row {column} which makes it easier to identify the lines. 
The second shows the character who is speaking {char}.
The third one shows the dialog of the different characters {dialog}.
The last one shows the movie in which the dialog is presented {movie}. 

I deleted the {column} and renamed {char} to {character} as mentioned in exercise 5.2.
